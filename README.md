### AWE  HTML KIT 
The AWE HTML Kit makes it easy to build Tubes  that interact with the [AWEmpire API](http://awempire.com) , without writing a line of JavaScript.

### Getting Started
 **Credentials**

> To get started you should have an account with  [AWEmpire](http://awempire.com). After registering you will be provided with a `PSID` and an `accessKey` These can be found on the dashboard once you login onto the website. They are needed in other for you to be able to retrieve content using the HTML Kit.

**The SDK**

> In other for you as a user to not write Javascript to create your tube, we had to write it all out so that you don't have to. All of this is tucked away in a javascript library or SDK. You will need to pull this into your HTML files in other to use them. All you have to do is copy and paste the below into your HTML page.

    <script
    
    src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/EDDYMENS/awe-html-kit@e078c6b6/awe-sdk.js"
    
    data-awe-connection
    
    data-awe-PSID="PSID-Here"
    
    data-awe-clientIp="clientIp-Here"
    
    data-awe-accessKey="accessKey-Here"
    
    ></script>

 and be sure to replace the `PSID-Here` and `accessKey-Here` with the one you copied from the Dashboard.  For the `clientIp-Here` , replace it with the IP of the server you are currently hosting the HTML pages with, If you are doing this on your development machine you may use `0.0.0.0`
